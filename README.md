# C1 KAGGLE-Divorce-Prediction
## Authors: Sanel Štein, Karl-Markus Hannust

### Motivation and goals

Divorce is a social issue that impacts individuals and families. Identifying the factors that
contribute to the dissolution of marriages can help professionals develop better support systems
and prevent relationship breakdowns.

The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that
contribute to divorce.
A secondary goal is to develop predictive tools that can estimate the likelihood of
divorce based on available data. Accurate prediction models can help professionals recognize
early warning signs and allocate resources more effectively.
Together, these goals help turn data into useful insights that can support healthier and more
stable relationships.

## Contents of the repository
C1_report.pdf - CRISP-DM report of the project
Project.ipynb - Main jupyter notebook file with the project's code
README.md - the README file of the project
divorce_data.csv - the second dataset containing 170 rows of data about Turkish couples from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/divorce-prediction/data
divorce_df.csv - the first dataset containing 5000 rows of simulated data about couples from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vanpatangan/divorce-prediction

## To replicate the same analysis
1. The data can be downloaded from Kaggle.
2. Apply preprocessing steps described in the project.
3. Train machine learning models using RandomForest, KNN, Decision Tree, SVC and Logistic Regression algorithms on both datasets.
4. Evaluate the models' performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and ROC AUC.
